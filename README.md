# Scripts

This repository contains a hodgepodge collection of mostly BASH scripts. Some are generic enough to be useful to many others. Some are highly specific and might not be useful to anyone else at all. Many were created with the help of an AI model, typically Grok 2, Grok 3 or one of the Claude variants. They're pretty good at sorting out things like awk parameters or handling formatting of numbers and dates - not exactly BASH's strong suit after all.

## GitHub

These scripts are helpful when dealing with GitHub repositories.

- [GitHubSync](https://github.com/500Foods/Scripts/blob/main/githubsync/githubsync.md) - Sync GitHub repositories with local copies, mostly intended as a backup mechanism
- [CLOC](https://github.com/500Foods/Scripts/blob/main/cloc/cloc.md) - Add "count lines of code" to the README.md of a GitHub repository
